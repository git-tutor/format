# `git4ol` Activities

At it's core a learning experience can be thought of as a guided set of activities a student takes to eventually get certified on a defined topic.

In `git4ol` we translate that experience to `git` commits and refs and the same way that `git` commits are the main building blocks of a `git` repository activities are the main building blocks of a `git4ol` lesson.
