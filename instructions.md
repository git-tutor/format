# `git4ol` Instructions

This document describes how to format you `git` commit message using [YAML](http://yaml.org/) [Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Format

A `git` commit message is usually formatted this way:

```
Title as a one line

Further text as multiple lines
```

We extend this format to:

```
Title as one line of plain text

---
propery: value
---

Further text as multiple lines of markdown
```
